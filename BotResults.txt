As a result I have no relationship with anyone near me.

I don't like customers.

There is this - a small, friendly, but very mysterious, yet highly emotional, woman named Evelyn, my "primal woman."

Uh-oh.

I can't believe you're out here, risking my life to tell my friends about it.

What were you looking at?

You're such a nasty, selfish asshole.

You know, I don't know if I could do this if you didn't.

You're the last person that I want to see again.

You'd better watch out!

It's only really working once.

And now he's gone.

And what is he worth?

I do not know, but I don't think I would have thought of all the things that go with that.

And before the Inquisition, the Permission was required to hunt the worst of the Abominos.

He is, technically, but not in the sense of legal immunity.

What's wrong with comfort and efficiency?

You humans are becoming our enemies.

I was hoping for some kind of therapy for this, but unfortunately there's nothing.

Man Down

I'll pull that plug now.

That's how I win - faking.

In the street, in the darkness.

And then somebody will kill him.

She likes to play with herself.

No.

I never wanted to end up like this to begin with.

Well, this sucks.

Uh, it's okay.

What are you, the hysterically ambitious little bitch?

Noooooo!

We may, but it won't be enough.

We may not be, but we'll get through...

What?

There's nothing we can't do.

And I must say, I'm very glad I did.

I simply want to save humanity.

Try me.

This is why I stay alone...

Kindness is not always the answer.
